# 1. Files
Files and CSV output
## file
data stored at a hard disk or other storage that persists over time.

- open(filename, 'r') # open a file and use it for reading
- open(filename, 'w') # open a file and use it for writing
- <file_variable>.read() # get contents to a string
but if file is large, it would be a problem for your computer to handle all of that in memory at once.
- <file_variable>.readline() # get next line of strings
- <file_variable>.readlines() # get list of strings
- <file_variable>.write(<astring>) # add a string to the end of the file
- iterate lines over a file
  ```
  for line in <file_variable>.readlines():
    # do something
  ```
  ```
  for line in <file_variable>:
    # do something
    # python provides a built-in way to iterate through the contents of a file one line at a time,
    # without first reading them all into a list.
  ```

- use with to open files
```
with open('<filename>','r') as md: # == md = open('<filename>', 'r')
  # contents = md.realine() 
  # lines = md.readlines() -> both not be good to use when working with large data. use belowâ†“
  for line in md:
    # do something to read line
  md.write('abc') # write to file
```
Python has the notion of a context manager that automates the process of doing common operations at the start of some task, as well as automating certain operations at the end of some task..

For reading and writing a file, the normal operation is to open the file and assign it to a variable,
and at the end of working with a file the common operation is to make sure that file is closed.

- <file_variable>.close() 

## CSV(Comma Separated Values) output
- parse csv file
1) manually: parse each line, split by comma
2) use Python csv module

- write data to csv file
1) manually: use format string, or join method, or string concatenation
```
olympians = [("John Aalberg", 31, "Cross Country Skiing, 15KM"),
             ("Minna Maarit Aalto", 30, "Sailing"),
             ("Win Valdemar Aaltonen", 54, "Art Competitions"),
             ("Wakako Abe", 18, "Cycling")]
for olympian in olympians:
  row_string = '"{}", "{}", "{}"'.format(olympian[0], olympian[1], olympian[2])
  row_string = '"{}", "{}", "{}"'.format(*olympian) # to print multiple value, should change variable type to tuple
  row_string = '"{}", "{}", "{}"'.format(olympian) # -> "('John Aalberg', 31, 'Cross Country Skiing, 15KM')", "", ""
```

# 2. Dictionaries
Collection of items, unordered, kind of a bag of key-value pairs.
## 1) create dictionary
```
dict = {}
dict['one'] = 'uno
```
## 2) delete key-value pair from dictionary
```
del dict{<key_name>}
```
## 3) reset value of ke
```
dict{<key_name>} = <new_value>
```
## 4) number of key-value pairs
```
len(dict)
```
## 5) methods
method | memo
--|--
dict.keys() or list(dict.keys()) | use for loop to iterate every key without any guarantee of order
dict.values() or list(dict.values()) | 
dict.items() or list(dict.items()) | key-value pairs as tuples
if <key_name> in dict | if key exist in dictionary
dict.get(<key_name>) | return value of key, *if key does not exist, returns None*, which is different from simple dict[<key_name>]
dict.get(<key_name>, <value>) | if key exist, return the value, if not exist, use <value> as its value(which is adding key-value pair) and return this <value>

## 6) alias
```
dict = {'right': 'nothing'}
alias = dict # pointing to the same value(dictionary)
alias['right'] = 'left'
print(dict['right']) # -> changes value of dict
# -> print 'left'
```
