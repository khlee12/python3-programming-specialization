Files and CSV output
## file
data stored at a hard disk or other storage that persists over time.

- open(filename, 'r') # open a file and use it for reading
- open(filename, 'w') # open a file and use it for writing
- <file_variable>.read() # get contents to a string
but if file is large, it would be a problem for your computer to handle all of that in memory at once.
- <file_variable>.readline() # get next line of strings
- <file_variable>.readlines() # get list of strings
- <file_variable>.write(<astring> # add a string to the end of the file
  

- <file_variable>.close()
